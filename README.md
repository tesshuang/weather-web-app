### Assumptions made

Use this section to tell us about any assumptions that you made when creating your solution.

1. This web application is aimed to display weather forcast data for the next 5 days.
2. The weather information that users usually are looking for is an icon overview, max/min temperature, wind, visibility and humidity.
3. The default city of the forcast is Vancouver.
4. The web application is responsive to multiple breakpoints and devices.
5. Users can search different cities and get the weather data.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made

If applicable. Did you do something that you feel could have been done better in a real-world application? Please
let us know.

It's a responsive web application that has a clean and clear user interface. It has a good amount of information for users based on the devices they are using

### Stretch goals attempted

If applicable, use this area to tell us what stretch goals you attempted. What went well? What do you wish you
could have done better? If you didn't attempt any of the stretch goals, feel free to let us know why.

I am able to complete the stretch goals as requested by using the tech stack I chose. I wish I would've done better
draft a rough design before implementing the styling code.
